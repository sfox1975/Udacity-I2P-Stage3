# Udacity-I2P-Stage3
Movie trailer website (showing a few of my favorites) 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to practice using python Classes, by building a movie trailer website. This was done as the Stage 3 project for Udacity's Intro to Programming Nanodegree. Each movie trailer calls an instance of the class 'Movie'.

## Additional Documentation
The following additional documents are included in this repository:
* fresh_tomatoes.py: primarily generates the webpage (style and content)
* media.py: contains the 'Movie' class.
* entertainment_center.py: contains the content for the movies of interest (e.g. title, storyline, poster image, link to trailer). Additional movies would be added here, if desired.


## Usage
To view the movie website, save all 3 python files to a single directory. Navigate to the directory in terminal and type the following:
`python entertainment_center.py`
This will launch the movie website in your default browser. By clicking on a movie image, the trailer will load from youtube.com.
